Made this public for archival purposes

## Purpose

This served as a conference management tool. It hosted a website and displayed talks, what room they were in and what time they were at.

Speakers have bio pages and everything has a nice admin interface to manage it.

If you want to fork this and make it better, or use it for your conference, you just have to swap out the templates with your own.

Otherwise, it's released under the MIT license.
